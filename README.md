## Problem
### Background
- The application creates dynamic resumes for a given user. Each resume can contain different job history profiles. Each job can contain custom skills. Once a resume is created, it can be saved to a user's profile. 
### 
### The Problem
- In today's multi-hyphenate, gig economy-focused economy, only having one traditional chronological resume to show a potential employer or client is limiting. Instead, being able to create customized resumes depending on the situation allows job seekers more flexibility to pivot and show different skillsets to different employers.
- Manually re-creating a resume (and cover letter) takes a lot of time and effort to produce and send to an employment opportunity. Having custom profiles ready to publish online or download on-demand will allow job seekers the ability to apply for more jobs.
- There is demonstrated evidence that there is a gap between open positions and available workers to fill those jobs. One reason may be the inability of a job seeker to apply for multiple jobs in different industries. Job seekers may be dissuaded by the inability to customize their resume to match each job requirement. This tool will allow job seekers to more efficiently apply for jobs and reduce overall unemployment rates.


### Our Approach
- A Ruby-on-Rails application to create and publish custom resumes for a given user that can be saved and re-factored easily and quickly.


### Goals & Success
- To be able to produce custom resumes that are saved online for reference and on-demand viewing.
- To create a web-based solution to effect the above objective.
